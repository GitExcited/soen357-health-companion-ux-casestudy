        <h2>About the App</h2>
        <p>
          We're developing a  new mobile app
          aimed at helping individuals with chronic health conditions manage their
          medications and doctor appointments. The app will allow users to set
          reminders, track their medication usage, and communicate with
          healthcare professionals.

        <h2>User Journey Mapping</h2>
        <p>
          For the user journey I used Persona 2. I showed the different stages of their usage of the application, from first hearing of it, to trying out some features to eventual acceptance and making it part of their habits.

        <h2>Wireframing and Prototype Design</h2>
        <p>
          For the wireframes I decided to show the main page which wil contain an easy access to the main app features. The calendar wireframe also has a simple design where the medicine 
          are elements at the bottom of the page. I showed a simple chat page as well to show the doctor chat feature. Lastly a simple settings page. The focus was simplicity and focusing 
           on the features that mattered to the two personas.
