        <h2>About the App</h2>
        <p>
          We're developing a  new mobile app
          aimed at helping individuals with chronic health conditions manage their
          medications and doctor appointments. The app will allow users to set
          reminders, track their medication usage, and communicate with
          healthcare professionals.

        <h2>Our Research Process</h2>
        <p>
          As part of our UX case study, we conducted user research to gather valuable insights.
          We utilized a research form to collect feedback and understand user needs.
          Below is the link to the form we used:

    <section class="key-findings-section">
      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <p>
        • Observed user preferences for medicament tracking tools. This could be for daily pills, weekly doctor apointments or any other medicine related event they want to schedule.
        <br />
        • Importance of alerts and notifications. A big pain point is remembering to take medicine at the correct time. A distinctive alert noise through their devices would help with that.
        <br />
        • Seamless communication with their medical advisor. Users would like to be able to contact their doctor for general questions about their medication or to book appointments.

            <li>To maintain independence from relying too much on family</li>
            <li>To reduce his anxiety over forgotten medications</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Frustrations:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Seeing that he forgot to take his pills in the morning when it's already night</li>
            <li>Manually keeping track through notes </li>

          <h4>App usage </h4>
          <p>Michel would use the app to write down which medication he needs to take and their respective times of the day. He would also use the automatic reminder feature on his phone which shows a simple and recognizable sound when he needs to take his medicine. He could also use a medication instruction feature that would show him instructions on how to take certain medicines which are trickier like pills that need to be taken with food, that may have interactions with foods like alcohol or that have side effects such as drowsiness. All these features will have easy to read instructions with large text and optional voice instructions.

        <h2>User Journey Mapping</h2>
        <p>
          For the user journey I used Persona 2. I showed the different stages of their usage of the application, from first hearing of it, to trying out some features to eventual acceptance and making it part of their habits.
        </p>

      <section class="wireframing-prototype-section">
        <h2>Wireframing and Prototype Design</h2>
        <p>
          For the wireframes I decided to show the main page which wil contain an easy access to the main app features. The calendar wireframe also has a simple design where the medicine 
          are elements at the bottom of the page. I showed a simple chat page as well to show the doctor chat feature. Lastly a simple settings page. The focus was simplicity and focusing 
           on the features that mattered to the two personas.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Wireframes:</h3>

        </div>
  
        <h3>Prototype:</h3>
        <p>
          The final prototype is heavily inspired by the wireframe. I focused on the main features the personas would use. Those are the <b>doctor chat feature</b>, the <b>medication history </b> and the  <b>medication calendar reminders and tracking</b>. 
          I chose a green background-color due to its link to health and medicine with a secondary color of white. The main focus is to have menus easy to find and have each feature have its dedicated page that is understandable at first glance

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>
          The goals of my testing plan would be to test the main features that I gathered from my research on the prototype I created.       </p>
  
        <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Evaluate the ease of use of the medication alarm and calendar feature</li>
          <li>Evaluate the ease of use  of the calendar page for medication tracking</li>
          <li>Assess user satisfaction with the overall app design</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>User Tasks:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a new medication to calendar and set it as taken          </li>
          <li>Modify the alarm time of a medication
          </li>
          <li>Contact a doctor and view your previous chat history
          </li>
          <li>Review a medication’s refill time and setup a pickup

          </li>
          <li>Find the last vaccine you took in your medical history

          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>Feedback Collection:</h3>
        <p>
          Those tasks would be analyzed by recruiting 5 to 10 participants from the demographics of our personas ( 50 years+) and who have medication management needs. It would also be important that these people have various levels of experience with technology. The participants could join in person or over an online call where they record their phone screen.

        </p>
  
        <h3>Analysis and Iteration:</h3>
        <p>
I would use various metrics to analyse the results such as: Time to complete task, user satisfaction, error rate. I could compile this information to analyze the data and find patterns on which tasks had the most frustration or ease of use. I could also categorize the user feedback to see what user’s thought and felt throughout the experiment. All this information would then be used to decide which actions to take.       </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          The beginning of this mini project was very vague in my mind. I had a general idea of what a health app looked like but I was far from understanding the real needs of the users and how to translate them into an UI. The UX design process helped me collect data to truly understand and get into the shoes of the user. Without this process, it would’ve been much harder to design a good UI. The research aspect of the process forced me to think about which questions and information I would need for the rest of the project. Since I only wanted to make a single survey, the questions had to be really well formulated to help me find the goals and pains of users as well as which functionalities they could need. All this data helped tremendously and I was able to truly process it as I built the personas and the user journey mapping. Both these tools helped me solidify much more the results of the survey in a way that stakeholders could easily understand. I found the user journey mapping particularly helpful when thinking about which ways a new user would begin interacting with the app for the first time.
A challenging part was designing the wireframe in Figma. I didn’t know how many screens I wanted to show and how to split the features in a way that was both intuitive and easy to access. My first prototypes had too little on each page which forced me to make too many pages. I ended up opting for a design with a simple main page which has all the most used features and a wireframe for each important feature. Additionally, the prototype was also challenging since I’m new to Figma so there was a learning and adaptation period.
Another challenge was the amount of writing and creativity that was involved in each step of this research. I spent a lot of time thinking what the personas would think or do for each page of the prototype. This required me to think about my own experience with applications and which features I liked or disliked. Overall I overcame this challenge by using inspiration resources, thinking about my personas and following my creativity inspiration.
